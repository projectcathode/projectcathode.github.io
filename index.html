                      "These simple conceptual structures shield us, pragmatically, from real-world complexity, but also fail, frequently, as some aspect of what we did not take into consideration makes itself manifest.",
                      "The failure of our concepts dysregulates our emotions and generates anxiety, necessarily, as the unconstrained world is challenging and dangerous.",
                      "Such dysregulation can turn us into rigid, totalitarian dogmatists, as we strive to maintain the structure of our no longer valid beliefs.",
                      "Alternatively, we can face the underlying complexity of experience, voluntarily, gather new information, and recast and reconfigure the structures that underly our habitable worlds.",
                      "Key words: belief, religion, ideology, category, object, novelty, anxiety, frame problem, exploration, amygdala, prefrontal cortex COMPLEXITY IS MORE UNAVOIDABLE THAN DEATH There is a long line of speculation in the classic psychoanalytic and early cognitive literature regarding the essential role that belief systems play in emotional regulation (Becker, 1973; Freud, 1928/1991; Kelly, 1955).",
                      "Freud posited that human beings constructed complex, irrational systems of fantasy, designed to rationalize and repress unacceptable and terrifying aspects of existence, such as death.",
                      "For Freud, ideas of deity, immortality and even transcendent morality were childish conceits, products of a superstitious and unscientific past, designed to shield the individual from the truth: everyone is ultimately vulnerable.",
                      "The well-defended individual does not face such truth, does not allow such facts into consciousness, because that realization would produce too much anxiety (Freud, 1928/1991).",
                      "The neo-Freudian cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker (1973) extended Freud's beliefs about religion to ideology, integrating Freud's ideas, recast and arguably improved, with those of Otto Rank.",
                      "Becker believed that the emergence of self-consciousness rendered the individual's existential position in the world permanently intolerable.",
                      "The individual aware of his or her mortal limitation has to hide from reality: I believe that those who speculate that a full apprehension of man's condition would drive him insane are right, quite literally right.",
                      "Who wants to face up fully to the creatures that we are, clawing and gasping for breath in a Cortex, (2002) 38, 429-458 universe beyond our ken?.",
                      "Everything that man does in his symbolic world is an attempt to deny and overcome his grotesque fate.",
                      "Becker therefore presumed that human character was of necessity a vital lie.",

                      "Becker realized that there was something pathological about such necessary and inevitable dishonesty; knew that the trivialization of reality came at the cost of dignity and self-respect.",
                      "He believed that too much exposure to reality produced an intolerable chaos, that too little produced a narrow and unbearable restriction, and that the middle ground constituted a form of far-from-admirable but perhaps necessary philistinism (p.",
                      "Nonetheless, like Freud, Becker consistently reduced the highest human strivings to the need for yet another defence against the reality of finitude, and identified even the greatness of genius with the search for illusory immortality: The genius repeats the narcissistic inflation of the child; he lives the fantasy of the control of life and death, of destiny, in the body of his work (p.",

                      "Becker was therefore finally sceptical of the benefits of psychotherapy, in general (psychology as self-knowledge is self-deception, because it does not give what men want, which is immortality.",
                      "and, more broadly, of the value granted to insight itself: Can any ideal of therapeutic revolution touch the vast masses of this globe, the modern mechanical men in Russia, the near-billion sheep-like followers in China, the brutalized and ignorant populations of almost every continent?.",
                      "Men are doomed to live in an overwhelmingly tragic and demonic world.",
                      "This sophisticated neo-psychoanalyst saw the world, finally, as a place of existential catastrophe, from which human beings are protected by a shield of religious and ideological delusion – the delusion being first that life has some transcendent and ultimate value and second that human beings, qualitatively different from mere animals, somehow partake in that value.",
                      "Similar notions have more recently been put forth by theoretical (Greenwald, 1980) and experimental social psychologists, most particularly in the form of terror management theory (McGregor et al.",
                      "Freud's rationalist position, extended by Becker, must be given its due: religion and ideology can most definitely be used as a shield against weakness.",
                      "Much of what passes for religious and ideological thought is mere defensive oversimplification and rationalization.",
                      "However, it is still not clear that it is mortality itself that motivates necessary defensive repression, and poses the 430 Cortex Forum unbounded in its potential implications and, therefore, in its potential for generating negative affect.",
                      "Information generated or released as a consequence of error-motivated exploration may cause cascades of concept failure, down the presupposition hierarchy (Peterson, 1999a).",
                      "A plan rendered no-longer-operative may well comprise a key foundation block for many other equal, lesser or greater plans: as the proverb has it – for want of a nail the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost, for want of a horse the battle was lost, for want of the battle, the Kingdom was lost (see Carver and Scheier (1998) for a usefully extended hierarchical model of belief, in this vein).",
                      "So the tendency to remain ideologically committed to a given position (associated with failure to explore and update in the face of anomaly) is also motivated by the desire to maintain the current superstructure of belief and tradition, in the face of evidence that a currently-unspecifiably-large portion of it has been rendered dangerously and troublesomely invalid (Peterson, 1999a) (and, what is worse – dangerously and troublesomely invalid, by its own criteria).",
                      "Courageous, Creative Exploration as Process, not State, of Adaptation Of course, every error does not produce infinite anxiety.",
                      "The magnitude of the initial affective response is, all things considered, something proportional to the size of the goal-directed plan and conceptual system currently implemented.",
                      "It is far more devastating to fail an important examination or to miss a long-sought-after promotion than to stumble into a chair that someone moved in your office.",
                      "This is because larger-scale goal-directed schemas and their associated procedures or habits stabilize larger areas of territory, conceptualized both as space and time.",
                      "Larger territories simply take more effort to explore and to map, so the consequences of large scale plan failure are more devastating.",
                      "The problem is amplified when the larger territory so disrupted is shared, and therefore mapped, socially – when agreement with the principles of use and occupation have previously been carefully, dangerously and painstakingly negotiated with others, personally and historically.",
                      "This point is particularly important for understanding ideological rigidity, and ideologically rigid response to alternative viewpoints.",
                      "Two competing ideological systems may easily be predicated upon fundamentally opposed axioms – in which case to give credence to the opponent's viewpoint is simultaneously to disrupt the basic substructure of current belief, and its attendant restriction of complexity.",
                      "It is one thing to make an error while acting out a given, bounded plan.",
                      "It is another to encounter an alternate culture, or belief system, whose structure rests on axiomatic presuppositions at fundamental odds with yours.",
                      "Mircea Eliade, the great religious historian (1965, 1985), has pointed out that explosive periods of creativity often occur in the aftermath of contact between previously isolated cultures.",
                      "He is also careful to mention, however – like Tolstoy (1887/1983) – that the encounter between competing beliefs produces a psychological state akin to abstract death in the psyches of individuals unfortunate enough to constitute their spiritual battle-ground.",
                      "This point has also been thoroughly developed by Carl Jung (1967, 1968) and Nietzsche (1968, pp.",
                      "Cortex Forum In an age of disintegration that mixes races indiscriminately, human beings have in their bodies the heritage of multiple origins, that is, opposite, and often not merely opposite, drives and value standards that fight each other and rarely permit each other any rest.",
                      "Such human beings of late cultures and refracted lights will on the average be weaker human beings: their most profound desire is that the war they are should come to an end.",
                      "Belief does not shield death-anxiety, primarily, although it may serve that function.",
                      "This constraint is generally adaptive, pragmatically speaking, although it is sometimes merely defensive.",
                      "Individuals are therefore motivated to maintain the structure of their belief systems, because those belief systems are painfully constructed abstracted patterns of action, designed to meet desired motivational ends, in a world complex and anxiety-provoking beyond understanding.",
                      "The Freudian psychoanalysts presume that all cultural constructions are necessarily illusory, because the existential position of man is in the final analysis unbearable.",
                      "Becker (1973) believes, for example, that identification with culture shields the individual from fear of death, defends him or her from overwhelming anxiety, but provides only a vague causal mechanism: the provision of a culturally- acceptable forum for symbolic immortality, either in the form of contribution to a transpersonal historical edifice, or in the form of life after death.",
                      "The truth – typically – is far more complicated and interesting.",
                      "Cultural identity provides a mode of adaptation to the vicissitudes of life that is far from illusory.",
                      "It does so by providing traditional categories of conceptualization and patterns of habit that directly serve their stated (and unstated) functional purposes (Peterson, 1999a).",
                      "These purposes include (1) the provision of a stable and universally accepted mode of interpretation and habit, so that social interactions are rendered predictable and mutually beneficial; and, simultaneously, (2) the provision of diverse socially-acceptable means of personal attainment.",
                      "In this dual manner, individual security may be obtained, and individual desire fulfilled, within a context that in the ideal remains both flexible enough to allow for update, and stable enough to allow for predictability.",
                      "The fact that all culturally-determined categories and patterns could be other than they are, in some ways, and still function, does not demonstrate that they are illusory: it is possible to attain considerable real security and success as a physician or as a lawyer, for example, or as a Christian or a Jew, despite the differences in approach, value and belief that characterize these different modes of being.",
                      "This flexibility of modes of adapted being is merely one more illustration that the world is sufficiently complex to bear being parsed up, functionally, in many different manners.",
                      "Furthermore, the symbolic immortality offered by such cultural-religious systems is far from merely defensive, and has not been properly understood, or even attended to, by academic psychologists or cognitive scientists.",
                      "Becker (1973) attempted to provide closure of psychoanalyis on religion (pp.",
                      "He essentially ignored Jung's contribution to this topic, however, because the meaning of Jung's work on alchemy (Jung, 1963, 1967, 1968), which occupied the latter half of Jung's life, remained opaque to him: I can't see that all Cortex Forum 451 (Jung's) tomes on alchemy add one bit to the weight of his psychoanalytic insight (Becker, 1973, pp.",
                      "There is no doubt that Jung's alchemical writings are difficult, but this is in part because they are revolutionary, at least from the perspective of modern psychology.",
                      "Jung split with Freud on the topic of religion (see Ellenberger, 1970).",
                      "Freud believed that religious thinking was defensive, in the same way that a neurosis was defensive – believed that religious thinking was self-deceptive, and necessarily and usefully supplanted by a sceptical rationality.",
                      "Jung believed, by contrast, that religious thinking constituted mankind's essential but metaphorically-predicated adaptation to the totality of existential or phenomenological reality (although such thinking could be petrified, so to speak, into dogma and used in a purely defensive manner).",
                      "His publication in 1911/1912 of the original German version of Symbols of Transformation (Jung, 1952), the first of his mature, alchemy-related works, was precisely the act that made his viewpoint qualitatively different from Freud's, and ensured his break in personal relations with Freud.",
                      "Jung's perspective on alchemy is extraordinarily difficult to summarize (see Peterson, 1999a, for a differentiated analysis), but its essential features can perhaps be laid out comprehensibly.",
                      "He predicated his argument on the idea that cognitive categories necessarily transform over time, and demonstrated that the pre-empirical idea of matter therefore bore little resemblance to its modern counterpart.",
                      "Matter for the pre-experimentalist was something more like chaos, psychologically speaking (something more like the unknown, or the undesired, or the emotion-inspiring, or, more particularly, something like complexity or anomaly): something more like what we mean when we say it matters or that is a weighty matter or what does it matter? or when we note that the object is precisely something that surprisingly objects to the realization of our desires.",
                      "The anomalous matter of the object, from such a perspective, is import, before it is entirely manifested or, more fundamentally, world, before it is revealed.",
                      "since Parmenides Greek philosophy had assumed an identity between being and reason on the one hand and on the other presupposed that reason works upon some formless or unformed stuff which is never completely tractable.",
                      "In the thought of Aristotle matter is ‘a remnant, the non-existent in itself unknowable and alien to reason, that remains after the process of clarifying the thing into form and conception.",
                      "This non-existent neither is nor is not; it is not yet, that is to say it attains reality only insofar as it becomes the vehicle of some conceptual determination' (Jaeger, 1968, pp.",
                      "This perspective on matter is derived from a much more archaic and diversely-derived religious tradition (Eliade, 1978), predicated on the idea that the cosmos was derived from the interaction between the Logos or Word or seminal action of a creator-God, and the more basic, virtual, unformed matter of chaos.",
                      "From the Jungian perspective (more accurately, from a traditional but mostly implicit religious perspective) the individual serves as the embodiment of that dynamic Word or seminal process, when he or she is fashioning the 452 Cortex Forum as that the individual is provided with a dual means of coping with vulnerable mortality in a meaningful and functional manner – first, as a consequence of his identity with social order and, second, as a consequence of his ability to voluntarily face chaos, complexity and anomaly, recast the protective strictures of tradition, and prevail.",
                      "This dual manner of coping is, to say it again, real, rather than illusory.",
                      "The protection of culture is granted as a consequence of the provision of historically elaborated concepts and plans whose incarnation in behavior produces results that are necessary, intended and desired.",
                      "This real protection is limited, however: the past is static by its very nature (is a state), and can therefore never provide complete information about the present or future.",
                      "This means that the embodiment of past wisdom in present behavior will inevitably result in error, in anomaly, in unrevealed world, in chaos.",
                      "In consequence, the healthy individual – however socially-adapted, must also play the hero, whose embodiment also provides real protection from the unknown, and who is therefore represented in traditional accounts as a divine psychological (spiritual) process (Peterson, 1999a).",
                      "The individual must be willing to voluntarily face the consequences of the errors of the past, to mine the information embedded in the territory whose existence is revealed by those errors, and to reconstruct society and self, in consequence.",
                      "This all implies that those most likely to use identification with the current culture as a terror-management strategy (and to denigrate, punish or destroy those who threaten that protective culture) are precisely those who refuse to face the consequences of their own errors, and who directly and literally weaken the functional integrity of their personalities and the states they inhabit by doing so.",
                      "The inevitable consequence of such weakening is increased existential anxiety, hopelessness, frustration, depression and anger, as poorly-laid plans produce results that are neither intended nor desired.",
                      "Such weakening also engender ever- more intense desire to remain safely ensconced within the confines of the cultural world-model, and increases the probability that the capacity to deal with anomaly will become ever-more rejected and unlikely.",
                      "Ideological rigidity is therefore the tendency to avoid emotionally and cognitively-demanding exploration and information-gathering, subsequent to the receipt of an error message, in the interests of maintaining short-term emotional security.",
                      "Events that indicate error in the pursuit of goals are negatively valenced, but informative.",
                      "Ideologically rigid individuals sacrifice new and potentially useful information – and, therefore, personality and habitable world – to avoid short-term negative emotion.",
                      "This makes totalitarianism of belief something that may be indulged in by default, so to speak – a sin of omission – and something that is potently reinforced, negatively, in the short term.",
                      "This combination of ease and emotional relief might help explain the widespread prevalence of rigid, maladaptive belief.",
                      "Dogmatic certainty is a condition that may be thoughtlessly and carelessly indulged in – a condition that lurks constantly as a temptation, as a second-rate alternative to the travail of authentic adaptation.",
                      "This is the inauthenticity of the existential phenomenologists (Boss, 1963; Binswanger, 1968), the deadly spiral of the adversarial personality into chaos, and a process that inevitably breeds hatred for vulnerable existence 454 Cortex Forum (Peterson, 1999a; 1999b).",
                      "It is impossible to understand anything about the nature of the now-defunct Soviet Union, for example, without developing some appreciation for the integral causal interplay between individual capacity for rigidity and self-deception and genocidal totalitarian illusion (Solzhenitsyn, 1975).",
                      "Anomalies are unsettling because they represent everything that lies outside the domain of the understood world.",
                      "Complexity lacks the simplifying and constraining boundaries defining the objects that characterize known territory.",
                      "In consequence, we have profound, a priori motivation to avoid anomaly, to ignore complexity, and to maintain the structural integrity of our belief systems.",
                      "Anything unexpected (new phenomena, new ideas, new people) re-introduces the overwhelming complexity that our beliefs simplify.",
                      "This introduced complexity, in turn, threatens the stability and security that our beliefs tentatively confer on existence.",
                      "Freud described religious beliefs as illusions, motivated by wish- fulfillment.",
                      "Such beliefs can be more accurately understood as culturally-shared and accepted strategies for pragmatically managing complexity.",
                      "It is necessary for us to generate simplified, functional models, in order to function in situations constantly beyond our understanding.",
                      "However, this process of simplified functional modeling can be pathologized by individuals who are unwilling to allow any unconstrained complexity whatsoever to exist – pathologized, that is, by the existential cowards who make ideological purity the hallmark of existence.",
                      "What Becker and the neo-Freudians describe as death terror can be more accurately conceptualized as a priori fear of unconstrained complexity.",
                      "Mere belief cannot keep such complexity permanently at bay, because all models are simplified, functional representations of an exceedingly intricate underlying reality.",
                      "This means that adaptation is by necessity a process (that is, the process of confronting complexity, voluntarily) as well as a state – despite the claims of committed ideologues to absolute comprehensiveness of current belief.",
                      "The adapted human being is protected by a functional shell of belief – but he or she is also able to repair that shell, or even to reconstruct it in its entirety, when it is challenged by a shift in circumstance or environment.",
                      "Ideologically committed individuals, by contrast, make personal omniscience, in the guise of obeisance to a transpersonal belief system, an axiom of individual faith.",
                      "In consequence, they undermine, then destroy, their personal capacity to explore and update, since everything that needs to be known has in their view been already discovered.",
                      "Furthermore, they make their own suffering – a consequence of the insufficiency of their beliefs – heretical, and attempt to eradicate by whatever means possible anything that exposes their true pathology and weakness.",
                      "Religious stories, occupying the necessarily metaphorical space at the base of our cultures of belief, provide the foundation for the dogmatic concepts and action patterns that structure our social interactions, and stabilize the territories that we all share.",
                      "Much of it establishes the necessary arbitrary groundwork for shared social being, in the absence of real certainly, and instead of constant interpersonal conflict.",
                      "More importantly, however, functional religious systems ensure that our shared beliefs are predicated on a concept of the individual that makes respect for the capacity of courageous, creative individual action in the face of Cortex Forum 455 complexity the most fundamental and ineradicable of values (Peterson, 1999a).",
                      "This predication makes faith in belief, as a state something necessarily subordinate to faith in courageous action as a process.",
                      "This faith in process is a position that the totalitarian, who desires above all to be finally right, cannot tolerate, and attempts constantly to undermine and destroy.",
                      "This faith in process is also a final answer, not to the problem of death, which cannot be solved, but to the more fundamental problem of complexity, and attendant vulnerability.",

                      "I asked the minister, at one point, how he reconciled the story of Genesis with the creation theories of modern science.",
                      "He had not undertaken such a reconciliation; furthermore, he seemed more convinced, in his heart, of the evolutionary viewpoint.",
                      "I was looking for an excuse to leave, anyway – and that was the last straw.",
                      "Although I had grown up in a Christian environment – and had a successful and happy childhood, in at least partial consequence – I was more than willing to throw aside the structure that had fostered me.",
                      "No one really opposed my rebellious efforts, either, in church or at home – in part because those who were deeply religious (or who might have wanted to be) had no intellectually acceptable counter-arguments at their disposal.",
                      "After all, many of the basic tenets of Christian belief were incomprehensible, if not clearly absurd.",
                      "The virgin birth was an impossibility; likewise, the notion that someone could rise from the dead.",
                      "Did my act of rebellion precipitate a familial or a social crisis? No.",
                      "My actions were so predictable, in a sense, that they upset no one, with the exception of my mother (and even she was soon resigned to the inevitable).",
                      "The other members of the church – my community – had become absolutely habituated to the increasingly-frequent act of defection, and did not even notice.",
                      "Did my act of rebellion upset me, personally? Only in a manner I was not able to perceive, until many years later.",
                      "I developed a premature concern with large-scale political and social issues, at about the same time I quit attending church.",
                      "Why were some countries, some people, rich, happy and successful, while others were doomed to misery? Why were the forces of NATO and the Soviet Union continually at each other's throats? How was it possible for people to act the way the Nazis had, during World War Two? Underlying these specific considerations was a broader, but at the time ill-conceptualized question: how did evil – particularly group-fostered evil – come to play its role in the world? I abandoned the traditions that supported me, at about the same time I left childhood.",
                      "This meant that I had no broader socially constructed philosophy at hand, to aid my understanding, as I became aware of the existential problems that accompany maturity.",
                      "The final consequences of that lack took years to become 7fully manifest.",
                      "In the meantime, however, my nascent concern with questions of moral justice found immediate resolution.",
                      "I started working as a volunteer for a mildly socialist political party, and adopted the party line.",
                      "Economic injustice was at the root of all evil, as far as I was concerned.",
                      "Such injustice could be rectified, as a consequence of the re-arrangement of social organizations.",
                      "I could play a part in that admirable revolution, carrying out my ideological beliefs.",
                      "Looking back, I am amazed at how stereotypical my actions – reactions – really were.",
                      "I could not rationally accept the premises of religion – not as I understood them.",
                      "I turned, in consequence, to dreams of political utopia, and personal power.",
                      "The same ideological trap caught millions of others, in recent centuries – caught and killed millions.",
                      "When I was seventeen I left the town I grew up in.",
                      "I moved nearby and attended a small college, which offered the first two years of undergraduate education.",
                      "I involved myself there in university politics – which were more-or-less left wing at that time – and was elected to the college board of governors.",
                      "The board was composed of politically and ideologically conservative people: lawyers, doctors, and businessmen.",

                      "The left wing had a long and honorable history in Canada, and attracted some truly competent and caring people.",
                      "However, I could not generate much respect for the numerous low-level party activists I encountered at these meetings.",
                      "They seemed to live to complain: had no career, frequently; no family, no completed education – nothing but ideology.",
                      "They were peevish, irritable, and little, in every sense of the word.",
                      "I was faced, in consequence, with the mirror image of the problem I encountered on the college board: I could not admire many of the individuals who believed the same things I did.",
                      "My college roommate, an insightful cynic, expressed skepticism regarding my ideological beliefs.",
                      "He told me that the world could not be completely encapsulated within the boundaries of socialist philosophy.",
                      "I had more or less come to this conclusion on my own, but had not admitted so much in words.",
                      "Soon afterward, however, I read George Orwell's Road to Wigan Pier.",
                      "This book finally undermined me – not only my socialist ideology, but my faith in ideological stances themselves.",
                      "In the famous essay concluding that book (written for – and much to the dismay of – the British Left Book Club) Orwell described the great flaw of socialism, and the reason for its frequent failure to attract and maintain democratic power (at least in Britain).",
                      "Orwell said, essentially, that socialists did not really like the poor.",
                      "Socialist ideology served to mask resentment and hatred, bred by failure.",
                      "Many of the party activists I had encountered were using the ideals of social justice, to rationalize their pursuit of personal revenge.",
                      "Whose fault was it, that I was poor or uneducated and unadmired? Obviously – the fault of the rich, well-schooled and respected.",
                      "How convenient, then, that the demands of revenge and abstract justice dovetailed! It was only right to obtain recompense from those more fortunate than me.",
                      "Of course, my socialist colleagues and I weren't out to hurt anyone – quite the reverse.",
                      "We were out to improve things – but we were going to start with other people.",
                      "I came to see the temptation in this logic, the obvious flaw, the danger – but could also see that it did not exclusively characterize socialism.",
                      "Anyone who was out to change the world by changing others was to be regarded with suspicion.",
                      "The temptations of such a position were too great to be resisted.",
                      "It was not socialist ideology that posed the problem, then – but ideology, as such.",
                      "Ideology divided the world up simplistically into those who thought and acted properly, and those who did not.",
                      "Ideology enabled the believer to hide from his own unpleasant and inadmissible fantasies and wishes.",
                      "Such realizations upset my beliefs (even my faith in beliefs), and the plans I had formulated, as a consequence of these beliefs.",
                      "I could no longer tell who was good and who was bad, so to speak – I no longer knew who to support, or who to fight.",
                      "This state of affairs proved very troublesome, pragmatically as well as philosophically.",
                      "I wanted to become a corporate lawyer – had written the Law School Admissions Test, had taken two years of appropriate preliminary courses.",

                      "The world obviously did not need another lawyer, and I no longer believed that I knew enough to masquerade as a leader.",
                      "I became simultaneously dis enchanted with the study of political science, my original undergraduate major.",
                      "I had adopted that discipline so I could learn more about the structure of human beliefs (and for the practical, career-oriented reasons described previously).",
                      "It remained very interesting to me when I was at junior college, where I was introduced to the history of political philosophy.",
                      "When I moved to the main campus at the University of Alberta, however, my interest disappeared.",
                      "I was taught that people were motivated by rational forces; that human beliefs and actions were determined by economic pressures.",
                      "I could not believe (and still do not) that commodities – natural resources, for example – had intrinsic and self-evident value.",
                      "In the absence of such value, the worth of things had to be socially or culturally (or even individually) determined.",
                      "This act of determination appeared to me moral – appeared to me to be a consequence of the moral philosophy adopted by the society, culture or person in question.",
                      "What people valued, economically, merely reflected what they believed to be important.",
                      "This meant that real motivation had to lie in the domain of value, of morality.",
                      "The political scientists I studied with did not see this, or did not think it was relevant.",
                      "My religious convictions, ill-formed to begin with, disappeared when I was very young.",
                      "My confidence in socialism (that is, in political utopia) vanished when I realized that the world was not merely a place of economics.",
                      "My faith in ideology departed, when I began to see that ideological identification itself posed a profound and mysterious problem.",
                      "I could not accept the theoretical explanations my chosen field of study had to offer, and no longer had any practical reasons to continue in my original direction.",
                      "All my beliefs – which had lent order to the chaos of my existence, at least temporarily – had proved illusory; I could no longer see the sense in things.",
                      "I was cast adrift; I did not know what to do, or what to think.",
                      "But what of others? Was there evidence anywhere that the problems I now faced had been solved, by anyone, in any acceptable manner? The customary behavior and attitudes of my friends and family members offered no solution.",
                      "The people I knew well were no more resolutely goal-directed or satisfied than I was.",
                      "Their beliefs and modes of being seemed merely to disguise frequent doubt and profound disquietude.",
                      "More disturbingly, on the more general plane, something truly insane was taking place.",
                      "The great societies of the world were feverishly constructing a nuclear machine, with unimaginably destructive capabilities.",
                      "Why? Theoretically normal and well- adapted people were going about their business prosaically, as if nothing were the matter.",
                      "Why weren't they disturbed? Weren't they paying attention? Wasn't I? My concern with the general social and political insanity and evil of the world – sublimated by temporary infatuation with utopian socialism and political machination – returned with a vengeance.",
                      "The mysterious fact of the cold war increasingly occupied the forefront of my consciousness.",
                      "How could things have come to such a point? History is just a madhouse it's turned over all the stones and its very careful reading leaves you little that's unknown I couldn't understand the nuclear race: what could possibly be worth risking annihilation – not merely of the present, but of the past and the future? What could possibly justify the threat of total destruction? Bereft of solutions, I had at least been granted the gift of a problem.",
                      "I visited a maximum security prison on the outskirts of Edmonton, under the supervision of an eccentric adjunct professor at the University of Alberta.",
                      "The prison was full of murderers, rapists, and armed robbers.",
                      "I ended up in the gym, near the weight room, on my first reconnaissance.",
                      "I was wearing a long wool cape, circa 1890, which I had bought in Portugal, and a pair of tall leather boots.",
                      "The psychologist who was accompanying me disappeared, unexpectedly, and left me alone.",
                      "Soon I was surrounded by shoddy men, some of whom were extremely large and tough-looking.",
                      "He was exceptionally muscular, and tattooed over his bare chest.",
                      "He had a 9vicious scar running down the middle of his body, from his collarbone to his midsection.",
                      "The injury would have killed a lesser man, anyway – someone like me.",
                      "Some of the prisoners, who weren't dressed particularly well, offered to trade their clothes for mine.",
                      "This did not strike me as a great bargain, but I wasn't sure how to refuse.",
                      "Fate rescued me, in the form of a short, skinny, bearded man.",
                      "He came up to me – said that the psychologist had sent him – and asked me to accompany him.",
                      "He was only one person, and many others (much larger) currently surrounded me and my cape.",
                      "He led me outside the gym doors, and out into the prison yard, talking quietly but reasonably about something innocuous (I don't recall what) all the while.",
                      "I kept glancing back hopefully at the open doors behind us as we got further and further away.",
                      "We left the bearded prisoner, and went to a private office.",
                      "The psychologist told me that the harmless-appearing little man who had escorted me out of the gym had murdered two policemen, in cold blood, after he had forced them to dig their own graves.",
                      "One of the policemen had little children, and had begged for his life, on their behalf, while he was digging – at least according to the murderer's own testimony.",
                      "I had read about this sort of event, of course – but it had never been made real for me.",
                      "I had never met someone even tangentially affected by something like this; had certainly not encountered anyone who had actually done something so terrible.",
                      "How could the man I had talked to – who was so apparently normal (and so seemingly inconsequential) – have done such an awful thing? Some of the courses I was attending at this time were taught in large lecture theaters, where the students were seated in descending rows, row after row.",
                      "In one of these courses – Introduction to Clinical Psychology, appropriately enough – I experienced a recurrent compulsion.",
                      "I would take my seat behind some unwitting individual and listen to the professor speak.",
                      "At some point during the lecture, I would unfailingly feel the urge to stab the point of my pen into the neck of the person in front of me.",
                      "This impulse was not overwhelming – luckily – but it was powerful enough to disturb me.",
                      "What sort of terrible person would have an impulse like that? Not me.",
                      "I had been smaller and younger than my classmates, for most of my life.",
                      "I went back to the prison, a month or so after my first visit.",
                      "During my absence, two prisoners had attacked a third, a suspected informer.",
                      "They held or tied him down and pulverized one of his legs with a lead pipe.",
                      "I was taken aback, once again, but this time I tried something different.",
                      "I tried to imagine, really imagine, what I would have to be like to do such a thing.",
                      "I concentrated on this task for days and days – and experienced a frightening revelation.",
                      "The truly appalling aspect of such atrocity did not lie in its impossibility or remoteness, as I had naively assumed, but in its ease.",
                      "I was not much different from the violent prisoners – not qualitatively different.",
                      "I could do what they could do (although I hadn't).",
                      "Surprisingly, however, the desire to stab someone with my pen disappeared.",
                      "In retrospect, I would say that the behavioral urge had manifested itself in explicit knowledge – had been translated from emotion and image to concrete realization – and had no further reason to exist.",
                      "The impulse had only occurred, because of the question I was attempting to answer: how can men do terrible things to one another? I meant other men, of course – bad men – but I had still asked the question.",
                      "There was no reason for me to assume that I would receive a predictable or personally meaningless answer.",
                      "At the same time, something odd was happening to my ability to converse.",
                      "I had always enjoyed engaging in arguments, regardless of topic.",
                      "I regarded them as a sort of game (not that this is in any way unique).",
                      "Suddenly, however, I couldn't talk – more accurately, I couldn't stand listening to myself talk.",
                      "I started to hear a voice inside my head, commenting on my opinions.",
                      "Every time I said something, it said something – something critical.",
                      "The voice employed a standard refrain, delivered in a somewhat bored and matter-of-fact tone: You don't believe that.",
                      "The voice applied such comments to almost every phrase I spoke.",
                      "I knew the source of the commentary was part of me – I wasn't schizophrenic – but this knowledge only increased my confusion.",
                      "Which part, precisely, was me – the talking part, or the criticizing part? If it was the talking part, then what was the criticizing part? If it was the criticizing part – well, then: how could virtually everything I said be untrue? In my ignorance and confusion, I decided to experiment.",
                      "I tried only to say things that my internal reviewer would pass unchallenged.",
                      "This meant that I really had to listen to what I was saying, that I spoke much less often, and that I would frequently stop, midway through a sentence, feel embarrassed, and reformulate my thoughts.",
                      "I soon noticed that I felt much less agitated and more confident when I only said things that the voice did not object to.",
                      "My experiment had been a success; I was the criticizing part.",
                      "Nonetheless, it took me a long time to reconcile myself to the idea that almost all my thoughts weren't real, weren't true – or, at least, weren't mine.",
                      "All the things I believed were things I thought sounded good, admirable, respectable, courageous.",
                      "They weren't my things, however – I had stolen them.",
                      "Having understood them, abstractly, I presumed I had a right to them – presumed that I could adopt them, as if they were mine: presumed that they were me.",
                      "My head was stuffed full of the ideas of others; stuffed full of arguments I could not logically refute.",
                      "I did not know then that an irrefutable argument is not necessarily true, nor that the right to identify with certain ideas had to be earned.",
                      "I read something by Carl Jung, at about this point, that helped me understand what I was experiencing.",
                      "It was Jung who formulated the concept of persona: the mask that feigned individuality.",
                      "Adoption of such a mask, according to Jung, allowed each of us – and those around us – to believe that we were authentic.",
                      "Jung said: When we analyse the persona we strip off the mask, and discover that what seemed to be individual is at bottom collective; in other words, that the persona was only a mask of the collective psyche.",
                      "Fundamentally the persona is nothing real: it is a compromise between individual and society as to what a man should appear to be.",
                      "He takes a name, earns a title, exercises a function, he is this or that.",
                      "In a certain sense all this is real, yet in relation to the essential individuality of the person concerned it is only a secondary reality, a compromise formation, in making which others often have a greater share than he.",
                      "The persona is a semblance, a two-dimensional reality, to give it a nickname.",
                      "My dream life, up to this point, had been relatively uneventful, as far as I can remember; furthermore, I have never had a particularly good visual imagination.",
                      "Nonetheless, my dreams became so horrible and so emotionally gripping that I was often afraid to go to sleep.",
                      "They centered, in general, around a single theme: that of nuclear war, and total devastation – around the worst evils that I, or something in me, could imagine: My parents lived in a standard ranch style house, in a middle-class neighborhood, in a small town in northern Alberta.",
                      "I was sitting in the darkened basement of this house, in the family room, watching TV, with my cousin Diane, who was in truth – in waking life – the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.",
                      "The television picture and sound distorted, and static filled the screen.",
                      "My cousin stood up and went behind the TV to check the electrical cord.",
                      "She touched it, and started convulsing and frothing at the mouth, frozen upright by intense current.",
                      "A brilliant flash of light from a small window flooded the basement.",
                      "There was nothing left of the ground floor of the house.",
                      "It had been completely and cleanly sheared away, leaving only the floor, which now served the basement as a roof.",

                      "He offered this observation, for example: It must be admitted that the archetypal contents of the collective unconscious can often assume grotesque and horrible forms in dreams and fantasies, so that even the most hard-boiled rationalist is not immune from shattering nightmares and haunting fears.",

                      "I learned why people wage war – why the desire to maintain, protect and expand the domain of belief motivates even the most incomprehensible acts of group-fostered oppression and cruelty – and what might be done to ameliorate this tendency, despite its universality.",
                      "I learned, finally, that the terrible aspect of life might actually be a necessary precondition for the existence of life – and that it is possible to regard that precondition, in consequence, as comprehensible and acceptable.",

                      "The domain of the latter is the world of value – what is and what should be, from the perspective of emotion and action.",
                      "The world as forum for action is composed, essentially, of three constituent elements, which tend to manifest themselves in typical patterns of metaphoric representation.",

                      "The fact of this adaptation implies that the environment is in reality a forum for action, as well as a place of things.",
                      "The individual is protected from such fear as a consequence of ritual imitation of the Great Father – as a consequence of the adoption of group identity, which restricts the meaning of things, and confers predictability on social interactions.",
                      "When identification with the group is made absolute, however – when everything has to be controlled, when the unknown is no longer allowed to exist – the creative exploratory process that updates the group can no longer manifest itself.",
                      "This restriction of adaptive capacity dramatically increases the probability of social aggression and chaos.",
                      "Rejection of the unknown is tantamount to identification with the devil, the mythological counterpart and eternal adversary of the world-creating exploratory hero.",
                      "Such rejection and identification is a consequence of Luciferian pride, which states: all that I know is all that is necessary to know.",
                      "This pride is totalitarian assumption of omniscience – is adoption of God's place by reason – is something that inevitably generates a state of personal and social being indistinguishable from hell.",
                      "This hell develops because creative exploration – impossible, without (humble) acknowledgment of the unknown – constitutes the process that constructs and maintains the protective adaptive structure that gives life much of its acceptable meaning.",

                      "Loyalty to personal interest – subjective meaning – can serve as an antidote to the overwhelming temptation constantly posed by the possibility of denying anomaly.",
                      "Personal interest – subjective meaning – reveals itself at the juncture of explored and unexplored territory, and is indicative of participation in the process that ensures continued healthy individual and societal adaptation.",
                      "Loyalty to personal interest is equivalent to identification with the archetypal hero – the savior – who upholds his association with the creative Word in the face of death, and in spite of group pressure to conform.",
                      "Identification with the hero serves to decrease the unbearable motivational valence of the unknown; furthermore, provides the individual with a standpoint that simultaneously transcends and maintains the group.",

                      "The latter manner of interpretation – the world as place of things – finds its formal expression in the methods and theories of science.",
                      "Science allows for increasingly precise determination of the consensually- validatable properties of things, and for efficient utilization of precisely-determined things as tools (once the direction such use is to take has been determined, through application of more fundamental narrative processes).",

                      "More importantly, however, she has determined that approached in the wrong manner, the sculpture is dangerous (at least in the presence of mother); has discovered as well that the sculpture is regarded more highly, in its present unaltered configuration, than the exploratory tendency – at least (once again) by mother.",

Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick.",

If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated, chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand 22would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don't know? 21 We also presently possess in accessible and complete form the traditional wisdom of a large part of the human race – possess accurate description of the myths and rituals that contain and condition the implicit and explicit values of almost everyone who has ever lived.",

                      "Proper analysis of mythology, of the type proposed here, is not mere discussion of historical events enacted upon the world stage (as the traditionally religious might have it), and it is not mere investigation of primitive belief (as the traditionally scientific might presume).",

                      "Journey is a word connected with jour and journee, and metaphorical journeys, deriving as they mostly do from slower methods of getting around, usually have at their core the conception of the day's journey, the amount of space we can cover under the cycle of the sun.",

                      "The most common meaning of ‘way' in English is a method or manner of procedure, but method and manner imply some sequential repetition, and the repetition brings us to the metaphorical kernel of a road or path.",
                      "In the Bible ‘way' normally translates the Hebrew derek and the Greek hodos, and throughout the Bible there is a strong emphasis on the contrast between a straight way that takes us to our destination and a divergent way that misleads or confuses.",
                      "This metaphorical contrast haunts the whole of Christian literature: we start reading Dante's Commedia, and the third line speaks of a lost or erased way: Che la diritta via era smarita.",

                      "But as we read on we find that the Tao can, after all, be to some extent characterized: the way is specifically the ‘way of the valley,' the direction taken by humility, self-effacement, and the kind of relaxation, or non-action, that makes all action effective.",

                      "The traditional Christian (and not just Christian) notion that man has fallen from an original state of grace into his current morally degenerate and emotionally unbearable condition – accompanied by a desire for the return to Paradise – constitutes a single example of this meta-myth.",

                      "The idea that man needs redemption – and that re-establis hment of a long-lost Paradise might constitute such redemption – appear as common themes of mythology, among members of exceedingly diverse and long-separated human cultures.",

                      "By the early 60's, this work had advanced to the point where he could formulate the following key propositions – first: 29One possible approach to analyzing the process of reflection is to consider the nervous system as a mechanism which models the external world by specific changes that occur in its internal structure.",
                      "In this sense a distinct set of changes in the nervous system is isomorphic with the external agent that it reflects and resembles.",
                      "As an internal model that develops in the nervous system in response to the effect of agents in the environment, the image performs the vital function of modifying the nature of behavior, allowing the organism to predict events and actively adjust to its environment.",
                      "and second: My first encounter with phenomena which indicated that the higher divisions of the central nervous system form models of external agents involved the study of reactions to novel [stimulus features.",
                      "The peculiar feature of the orienting reflex is that after several applications of the same stimulus (generally five to fifteen) the response disappears (or, as the general expression goes, is extinguished).",
                      "However, the slightest possible change in the stimulus is sufficient to awaken the response.",
                      "Research on the orienting reflex indicates that it does not occur as a direct result of incoming excitation; rather, it is produced by signals of discrepancy which develop when afferent [that is, incoming] signals are compared with the trace formed in the nervous system by an earlier signal.",
                      "Sokolov was concerned primarily with the modelling of the events in the objective external world – assuming, essentially, that when we model, we model facts.",
                      "Most of the scholars who have followed his lead have adopted this central assumption, at least implicitly.",
                      "We do model facts, but we concern ourselves with valence, or value.",
                      "It is therefore the case that our maps of the world contain what might be regarded as two distinct types of information – sensory, and affective.",
                      "It might even be argued that animals – and human beings – are primarily concerned with the affective or emotional significance of the environment.",
                      "Along with our animal cousins, we devote ourselves to fundamentals: will this (new) thing eat me? Can I eat it? Will it chase me? Should I chase it? Can I make love to it? We model facts – there is no doubt about that.",

                      "Our most fundamental maps of experience – maps which have a narrative structure – portray the motivational value of our current state, conceived of in contrast to a hypothetical ideal, accompanied by plans of action, which are our pragmatic notions about how to get what we want.",
                      "Description of these three elements – current state, future state, and means of mediation – constitute the necessary and sufficient preconditions for the weaving of the most simple narrative, which is a means for describing the valence of a given environment, in reference to a temporally and spatially bounded set of action patterns.",

                      "It is the perceived improvement of point b that makes the whole map meaningful – that is, affect-laden; it is the capacity to construct hypothetical or abstract end points, such as b – and to contrast them against the present – that makes human beings capable of using their cognitive systems to modulate their affective reactions.",

                      "Nonetheless, they may be usefully considered as separable entities, for the purposes of introductory explication (as the extremes of a continuum might be regarded as opposites, for the sake of argument).",
                      "The domain mapped by a functional narrative (one that, when enacted, produces the results desired) might reasonably be regarded as explored territory, as events that occur there are predictable.",
                      "Any place where enacted plans produce unexpected, threatening or punishing consequences, by contrast, might be regarded as unexplored territory.",
                      "This means 30that a familiar place, where unpredictable things start happening, is no longer familiar (even though it might be the same place with regards to its strict spatial location, from the objective perspective).",

                      "Hudlicky is that he holds a prestigious Canada Research Chair, a position funded by part of a large federal initiative devoting approximately 300 million dollars per year in the attempt to attract to Canada (or to encourage to stay in Canada) researchers who are of particular promise, as evidenced most fundamentally by their research productivity.",
                      "That promise or productivity, in turn, can be measured with reasonable accuracy with metrics such as number of peer-reviewed articles in relevant scientific journals (more than 400 in Hudlicky's case), by noting how many times such articles are cited by other authors over the years subsequent to publication (Hudlicky: 13300) and, finally, by a metric known as the h-index, which provides a measure of how many publications have received a variable minimum number of citations (and which therefore combines in a single number some information about publications per se and some about citations).",

                      "The mere fact that he was hired as a Canada Research Chair meant that his department, as well as the federal governmental agency tasked with funding the attraction or retention of extreme talent, both determined in the relatively recent past that he was a fish well worth landing.",
                      "Something about this needs to be clarified: the universities that hire those researchers competent enough to be competitive in a Canada Research Chair competition are not doing them a favor by offering them a position; rather, it is an honor for the university (and the students, both undergraduate and graduate, that attend the institution) to be chosen by the researcher in question.",
                      "No serious academic disputes this, although some may quibble about the precise metrics used for identification of the serious talent.",
                      "This is particularly true of an institution such as Brock, which is an university of reasonable but not exceptional quality, and which genuinely needs highly productive faculty members to help it ratchet itself up the very competitive academic ladder.",
                      "Hudlicky's paper in Angewandte Chemie was peer-reviewed positively, judged as desirable by the relevant editorial staff, and published.",
                      "This meant that it managed the difficult job of passing through the eye of a needle, and entering the kingdom of heaven, at least as far as research chemists might be concerned.",

                      "It should be noted, by the way, that the position of editor for a scientific journal is general one filled by volunteers, who donate their time for the greater good of the scientific enterprise, rather than for any monetary gain.",

                      "What was Hudlicky's sin? His 12-page document (approximating 4000 words) dealt with issues he believed were affecting organic synthesis research and communication, and covered topics such as the range of research options available, integrity and trustworthiness of the relevant literature, transference of skills from mentor to trainee, impact of information technology, the corporatization of the university environment, the effect of new technology, the diversity of the available work force, and the competition for resources among researchers—all topics that people of putative good will and competence (such as the author and his reviewers and editors) could agree had a demonstrable effect on the quality of research currently conducted.",
                      "However, Hudlicky voiced a smattering of opinions that were deemed unacceptable by a small number of people who both read his submission and were somewhat active on Twitter.",
                      "Here are the sentences constituting his sins, which fall into two of the categories Hudlicky identified as relevant for analysis of research productivity.",
                      "I have paraphrased them very slightly for length: Under Diversity of Workforce: In the last two decades many groups have been designated with preferential status (despite substantive increases in the recruitment of women and minorities).",

                      "Such practice has also led to the emergence of mandatory training workshops on gender equity, inclusion, diversity, and discrimination.",
                      "So those apparently objectional words constitute 90 of 4000—a small proportion of the total content of the essay, and the proffering of an opinion that insists if: not that diversity, inclusivity and equality provisions necessarily produce prejudicial hiring practices (although the research evidence suggests that they clearly do [1])) then they may have a detrimental effect on research productivity.",
                      "It is also important to note that these opinions paraphrase very closely a decision reached and publicized by a German court in 2007, at least according to a supporter of Hudlicky who dared express an opinion supporting his colleague.",
                      "The Twitter mob trolls who objected to this opinion reacted as if what Dr.",
                      "Hudlicky said was that efforts to diversify hiring and student selection were definitively harmful, while what he truly did was only raise the possibilities that such actions could become counterproductive if they resulted in the exclusion of qualified candidates.",
                      "No one can object to this opinion, reasonably—unless they assume, as did Hudlicky's critics, that all claims to objectivity in hiring and selection are inextricably bound up with the systemic prejudice hypothetically characterizing all hierarchies of specialization.",
                      "Under Transference of Skills: The training and mentoring of new generations of professionals must be attended to by proper relationships of masters and apprentices without dilution of standards.",
                      "Hudlicky described two conditions under which the successful transfer of skills can occur: first, if the skill is not transferred within three generations, it is lost forever, and second, there must be an unconditional submission of the apprentice to his/her master.",

                      "This situation, coupled with the fact that professors have less and less time to mentor students in the laboratory, cannot provide for a productive transfer of skills, especially the maintenance of standards and integrity of research.",

                      "Acquisition of this knowledge required precisely the unfreedom recommended by Hudlicky—followed, of course (with the acquisition of the aptly named Master's degree) by autonomy in thought and action that was increased beyond what it would have been capable of achieving without the devoted apprenticeship in question.",
                      "Such a process can only be undertaken by a pupil capable of regarding his or her teacher as a true mentor, and by a mentor bent on producing a pupil more capable than him or herself, after an intensive period of training.",
                      "None of that, according to Hudlicky (and this is not obviously an unreasonable hypothesis in this day of age) is possible in the university as it is currently constituted, even in the departments that still teach hard sciences.",

                      "It is the willingness to undertake this apprenticeship, as well as the capability of superseding it, that makes up the master in Master's degree—a designation that I notice Brock still grants, despite potentially colonial overtones at least as damning as those that characterized Hudlicky's writing (if we are going to go down that absurd route).",
                      "He has faced severe retaliation on no less than seven separate fronts for his hypothetically unforgivable thoughts—the two we have already discussed, and five more, including, third, the cancelation of an entire issue of the journal Synthesis (published by Thieme), which was to be dedicated to his 70th birthday and for which invitations had already been sent to more than forty prominent scientists; fourth, the elimination of any mention of his work in yet another journal, Highlights in Chemistry; fifth, a statement by the Norwegian Chemical Society (not as of yet made public) hypothetically critiquing his ongoing collaborations with three Norwegian researchers; and sixth, his transformation into whipping boy by his own faithless professional colleagues at the administrative level at Brock University.",

                      "That would mean a preponderance of fictional works portraying women as front line soldiers, heavy equipment operators, bricklayers, etc.",
                      "while males should be portrayed pursuing currently-female dominated pursuits such as nursing.",
                      "This suggestions runs slightly at odds with the early policy introduced suggesting that the female-dominated occupations be left in their current skewed positions, for reasons of historical reparation, but it is simply not realistic to suggest that male characters (and their inevitable career trajectories) be left out of fiction provided to young readers entirely, which seems to be the only option other than presenting them as pursuing and enjoying non-sex-typed occupations.",
                      "At the later grades, that should continue, but it might be useful to introduce mandatory life plans, with each female student required by their guidance counsellors to outline an education or career plan that features an under-represented occupation as their goal.",
                      "The relevant psychological literature indicates that encouraging students to develop a detailed strategy for the pursuit of such goals does increase the likelihood that the plans will be implemented.",
                      "Strong encouragement for the implementation of these plans, once developed, should be provided.",
                      "The sort of interest that might tempt a given boy or girl toward a particular career has been engendered, so to speak, purely as a consequence of socialization pressure, so that whatever individual desire expressed by a given student that might run contrary to the new equity doctrines (such as claims for strong proclivity toward traditionally gendered roles) should be strongly discouraged, first to combat the internalized misogyny already discussed and second to disavow students, their parents, and society at the larger level from the notion than any truly individual desire exists (independent of social construction).",
                      "It would be best, perhaps, if this was allied with sex-typed differences in physical training.",
                      "As the average woman has 30% of the upper and 55% of the lower-body strength of the average man, this would mean comprehensive and continual and thorough and mandatory strength and endurance training programs for girls, beginning at puberty, when the sex differences in power start to manifest themselves.",
                      "It's not clear how to deal with the temperamental variability that also kicks in at the same time.",
                      "Assertiveness training would be required on the female front, empathy training on the male (while the differences in negative emotion would also have to be dealt with, in some manner that has not yet been established).",
                      "If we regard differential sexual representation as proof of systemic oppression, as the theory of social construction demands, then we are failing in our social and individual responsibility to social justice to delay implementing such policies immediately, and with full force.",
                      "Every year that passes with little to no movement on the front of sexual equity is indicative of a serious moral failure (and there has been remarkably little change in many occupations over periods of multiple decades with regard to representation by sex).",
                      "Thus, if we're serious about equity, as we seem to be required to be, since objecting to it instantly brings about accusations of misogyny and sexism (and alt-right sympathies, if not outright fascism) then there is simply no excuse not to implement these draconian but morally necessary policies as soon as possible.",
                      "Sexual inequality is only one small part of the problem.",
                      "After Sex: Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Class… After, say, a five or ten-year period, concentrating on sexual equity, it might be time to consider the same set of actions implemented for equity by race and ethnicity (if we assume that these are the next most important forms of oppression).",
                      "It is highly likely that the women who will benefit from the sex equity requirements outlined in this document will be those who have benefited in the past from their race.",
                      "This means white women (and perhaps even more particularly those who are white and Jewish, if we have decided to include Jewish people in the category of white).",
                      "Thus, it will be necessary and appropriate to produce a set of standards (including the rewriting of the fictional accounts described previously) to highlight women of color, and to promote their movement forward in precisely the same manner as was implement for women, per se.",
                      "And then we will have to concentrate a bit later on the other places where systemic prejudice is apparently self-evident: social class, age, attractiveness, disability, temperament—even perhaps education and intelligence).",
                      "It is also possible that some of these policies should be implemented simultaneously, with each job category favoring men also analyzed and assessed by race.",
                      "We could start with the three main races: Caucasian, Asian and Black (recognizing as we do so that these are merely social constructions, but must be treated now as realities because they have been treated as such in the past).",
                      "The dual implementation would be more costly and complex, and place a heavier administrative load on the companies and organizations affected, but would have the major advantage of redressing a number of historical injustices simultaneously.",
                      "Perhaps we could be optimistic about the possibility of success in pursuing such a comprehensive plan, and dare both.",
                      "Is This Truly What We Want? But perhaps we could also sit back and think a bit.",
                      "Are we really up for these large-scale interventions? Do we really believe that they are necessary and, even more naively, that they would solve more problems than they would cause? And what are we to make of the fact that women granted equality of opportunity appear to choose, freely (assuming such free choice exists) to work part-time more frequently, to move for career purposes less often, to work inside rather than outside, to pick safer occupations, and to choose education pathways, often dealing with people, that are associated with less lucrative careers? Are we to assume that they aren't making the right choices, because they are fouling up the equity doctrine, and to apply the substantive force that would be necessary to correct them? Or would it just be simpler to note the insane complexity and internal contradictions and impossibility and danger of the pursuit of this appallingly simple-minded dual insistence (1) that the West is a hotbed of patriarchal oppression (particularly compared to every other society that currently exists or has existed in the past, instead of contrasted with some hypothetical ideological utopia) and (2) that all indications of inequality of outcome are proof positive of the oppression so claimed? The truth of the matter is that there is no excuse for the equity doctrine.",
                      "Its proponents don't even concentrate on the areas where the largest sex differences exist.",
                      "They don't care at all that there are multiple well-documented reasons for unequal outcomes in occupational choice and pay.",
                      "They don't think through the policy implications or, if they do, are nonetheless willing to grant to themselves the bureaucratic power to implement by force the changes that would be theoretically necessary to balance the scales (and that would produce kick-backs of a magnitude that the yellow-jacket protests, for example, should make us leary of invoking).",
                      "They haven't contended at all with the data suggesting that free women make different occupational choices than free men, and that there are economic consequences to those choices that may be regarded as perfectly acceptable by the women, who could well be choosing time over money (a not-unreasonable trade-off).",
                      "They also do not consider that we currently do not know how to formulate a complex economy that does not produce inequality of outcome in general (as the non-free-market/non-Western states that still comprise the majority of the world are certainly less egalitarian in opportunity and outcome than the oppressive, patriarchal West—see data from The World Inequality Report 2018: https://wir2018.",
                      "world/), and they certainly don't consider the fact that radically unequal distributions are a somewhat ill-explained fact of life, governing phenomena as diverse as the size of cities, the numbers of species in a given genus, the comparative mass of stars (and of planets), the frequency of word use in given language, the number of creative endeavours characterizing individuals, the scoring success of professional athletes, hard disk drive error rates, the size of oil reserves in oil fields, the standardized price return on stocks, the size of sand particles (and of meteorites), the magnitude of casualty counts for many lines of business, and the volume of river discharges and annual maximum one-day rainfalls.",
                      "All this (plus the fact that inequality was a fact of life long before the modern industrial period) indicates that all attempts to attribute inequity to the particular pathologies of the oppressive patriarchy are not only incorrect, but wildly optimistic, as the problem that is posed by the universality of unequal distribution is apparently far deeper and far more intractable than anything that can be explained by or altered by simple economics.",
                      "Equity Doctrine As A Moral Weapon None of this stops the pushers of the DIE triad from using the doctrine of equity as a moral weapon, in service of their fundamental claim: white men historically and currently and unjustly and cruelly dominate, historically and currently (this despite the fact that American Asians, for example, make 30% more at the median than Caucasians in the US—a difference that is almost exactly the same as the gap between Caucasians and Latinos).",
                      "In consequence, all inequalities of outcome must be regarded as unjust, and used as proof of the central contention—that is, the idea of patriarchal Western oppression that is the central dogma of the radical left.",
                      "This is a terrible thing: not only because it identifies perpetrators who must be punished, and victims who must be coddled and protected (both equally dangerous consequences) but because it risks interfering with the progress that is actually being made to bring the world's poorest people up to a standard of living that is vastly improved over what was typical even twenty years ago, even in the poorest of countries.",
                      "Free democracies, with market economies (or even just the market economies themselves, with the freedom they inevitably bring) certainly produce inequality, just like every other economic and political system ever devised.",
                      "But they also produce wealth, and enough of that is distributed to those at the bottom of the hierarchy to life them out of the abject poverty that constitutes the utter misery of, say, excess child mortality, lack of access to any education whatsoever, and outright starvation.",
                      "Thus, there is no excuse for the radical leftists to claim virtue on behalf of their care for the poor, given that their entire doctrine is likely to (and has been indisputably shown to) make everything worse for precisely those upon whom their attention is so empathically lavished.",
                      "Conclusion: A Doctrine Too Far We know the left can go too far.",
                      "The North Koreans, and the Cubans, and the Venezuelans continue to teach us in the same manner.",
                      "We don't know exactly when and where the going too far begins.",
                      "But I'm willing to stake my claim on the equity doctrine.",
                      "In a word, it's inexcusable, both morally and practically, and should be regarded, in my estimation, as an ideological position that should be roundly rejected by anyone who wishes to be taken seriously in any reasonable political discussion.",
                      "And we should well remember that reasonable political discussion is the only alternative we have to outright strife and the kind of conflict that tends to degenerate rapidly and dangerously."];
